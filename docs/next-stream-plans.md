# READ THIS BEFORE YOU BEGIN

## Search

### AutoComplete
- Styling for autocomplete ....well it doesn't look very good. -- doesn't seem very feasible with the current package.
Best idea is to create own component later

### Search Button
- Animations can be made a bit better. -- revisit this later
- Connect the actual fetch logic using API for listing games for given search.
- Seperate component for search bar and move the shared storage to a store.

### Game genres and platforms (yes the json that was made that cannot used anymore cz why me)
- genre.value doesnt match the actual genre filter values that need to passed to the API
- platform.value are saved as ids and searched through usingthe ids .. so nned to figure out what id is or what platform.
- Finally update the json once you're done with that.

### Game Card

- get data from the store.
- create a sepearte component for recommendation row.
- skeleton loader for recommendation row.

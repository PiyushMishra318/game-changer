## Search

### AutoComplete
- Autocomplete shows the whole list doesn't filter already selected tags
- Styling for autocomplete ....well it doesn't look very good.

### Search Button
- Animations can be made a bit better.
- Dont search unless there's already selected tags.
- Disable the search button once isLoading is true
- Connect the actual fetch logic using API for listing games for given search.

### Game genres and platforms (yes the json that was made that cannot used anymore cz why me)
- genre.value doesnt match the actual genre filter values that need to passed to the API
- platform.value are saved as ids and searched through usingthe ids .. so nned to figure out what id is or what platform.
- Finally update the json once you're done with that.


### Game Card (horizontal scrolling)

- Design and list ganme cards based on search.
- If searched tags are empty just show best of all time games.
